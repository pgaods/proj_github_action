Here are the steps to push your local files to a remote GitHub repository:

1. **Initialize a Git repository**:
   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your project:
   ```bash
   cd C:\users\blah
   git init
   ```

2. **Add your files to the staging area**:
   ```bash
   git add src/train.py src/model_selection.py config/params.yml src/deploy/register_model.py
   ```

3. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

4. **Add the remote repository**:
   Replace `your-repo-url` with the URL of your GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin your-repo-url
   ```

5. **Push your changes to the remote repository**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin master
   ```

If you haven't created a GitHub repository yet, you can do so by logging into GitHub, clicking on the "New" button, and following the prompts to create a new repository. Once created, you can use the repository URL in step 4.
